HOMport
=======

Homport is a helper module to make manipulating nodes with HOM easier in
an interactive Python session

Connect nodes quickly:
 * node >> node2 -- connects output of 'node' to first input of 'node2'
 * node >> node2.input_two -- connects output of 'node' to the second input of
                           'node2'

Deal with parameters more easily:
 * print node.tx does the same as:
 * print node.parm('tx').eval()

Set values on Parms more easily:
 * node.tx = 500

Installation Instructions:
    You will be able to use pip to install it (when I get around to it):
    pip install git://github.com/schworer/homport homport/

    If you don't want to use pip, clone the repo and add it to your path
    manually:
    git clone git://github.com/schworer/homport homport/

    Then, put this in your 123.py or 456.py Houdini startup script:
        import homport
        homport.bootstrap()
    or, import it directly in the Python pane within Houdini.

I like unit tests, run them like so:
    hython test.py
